# CodeWizard Microservice Project

This project is a microservice-based architecture that includes a frontend application and an API gateway for handling communication between services. The microservice we're focusing on is the CodeBase Analyzer, which processes and analyzes codebases.

## Open Ports

| Port  | Service                | Access                          |
|-------|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 5000  | API Gateway             | âœ… All communications go through this gateway |
| 5173  | Default Frontend             | âš“ Frontend PORT |
| 3001  | CodeBase Analyzer       | ðŸš« No direct access, use API Gateway |

## Project Structure

```bash
CodeWizard/
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/            # React frontend application
â”œâ”€â”€ services/            # Microservices (e.g., codebase-analyzer, service-2)
â”œâ”€â”€ api-gateway/         # API Gateway configuration
â””â”€â”€ docker-compose.yml   # Docker Compose configuration file
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nxdun/CodeWizard.git
```

### 2. Build and Run the Services

To build and start the services, use Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### 3. Access the Frontend

The frontend is served on `http://localhost:5173` via Vite. Open your browser and navigate to the following address:

```bash
http://localhost:5173
```

### 4. API Gateway

The API Gateway (port `5000`) is responsible for routing requests between the frontend and the backend services. All communications are managed through this gateway.

### Docker Compose

Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed before proceeding. Docker Compose will orchestrate all services, including the frontend, backend, and API Gateway.

## Notes

- **Frontend Port:** The frontend runs on port `3000` locally.
- **API Gateway:** All backend services, including the CodeBase Analyzer, are accessed via the API Gateway on port `5000`.
- **CodeBase Analyzer:** This service is isolated and cannot be accessed directly; all requests must go through the API Gateway.
